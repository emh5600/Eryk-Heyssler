A repository containing just a few projects for future employers.

Python_AI_projects: A collection of projects written in Python that demonstrate AI programming. They are as follows:
  1) A simple demonstration of my knowledge in python programming.
  2) Exploration of uninformed search in N-queens, linear disk movement, and the classic 'Lights-out' problem.
  3) Application of informed search to puzzles and games.
  4) Spam filter using Bayes Naive classification.
  5) Simple Markov Model processing on text.
  6) Hidden Markov Models for part-of-speech tagging.

Malloc Lab: A dynamic memory allocator which uses a segregated free list. Main file: mm.c. Written in C.

Concurrency Lab : A program that is essentially a data structure for a channel. Demonstrates concurrent programming using semaphores, mutexes, and condition variables. Main files: channel.c, channel.h, buffer.c, buffer.h, linked_list.c. Written in C.

tsh : A tiny shell application. Written in C.

Sequential Calculator : A calculator application that takes in variables and arguments for computation. It uses concepts of data structures, object oriented programming, and recursion. Written in Python.

Drawing Application : A paint-like application. Written in Java.

Flight Scheduler : A flight scheduling system that is based heavily upon object oriented programming and MySQL. Must run the derby server FlightSchedulerDBErykemh5600 before running the main program. Written in Java with the use of a MySQL database.

Expression Tree Builder : Takes expressions in either infix or postfix, converts them to its complement, builds an expression tree, and does an inorder traversal to return the result. Written in C++ and Java.
